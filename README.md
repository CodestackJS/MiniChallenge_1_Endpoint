<b>Date:</b> 04/01/2024 <br>
<strong>Description:</strong>
Design an API endpoint that receives user input and outputs a personalized greeting such as "Hello, {user's name}!".  Utilize Postman to facilitate the data retrieval process. <br>
I decided to create a personalized greeting that also gives a randomized suggestion.  I used an array of strings and then randomized the index within my use of the array.<br><br>

NOTE!!!  my bin and obj folders were created after first use on my PC.  If you wish to see your first use, ERASE bin and obj  if necessary!!! <br><br>

Things to turn in: <br>
- project, zipped <br>
- github link in comments of LMS <br>

Comments:  <br> This is a simple challenge. As being David, there's no such thing as basic. He always try to level up his code by adding the array 
which is pretty interesteing and i've learned from his code by peer reviewing it.<br>
